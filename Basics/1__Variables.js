// Variables are the storage containers for values

let person_name = "Kishore";
person_name = "Kishore"
console.log(person_name)
var age = 25;
const designation = "Software developer";

// Variables declared with let keyword can't be declared again and it is block scope

// Variables declared with const keyword can't be redeclared or re-assigned and have block scope

// Naming Pattern:

    // Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores. names can start with letters or underscore but can't with numbers
    // Variable name are case-sensitive and avoid using keywords as variable names
